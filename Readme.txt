Here is two projects in github Evolent.Api and which WEB API and Evolent.ContactManager.Web is Application which access Evolent.Api Web API

You need to configure below "Baseurl" of WEB API (Hosted web API REST Service base url)  in Evolent.ContactManager.Web Application
string Baseurl = "http://localhost:65096/";

Technologies used 1) web API 2.0, ASP.Net MVC 5, C#, JQuery, EntityFramework 6.0 (Code First Approach)

Design Pattern MVC with IOC (inversion of control) & DI (Dependency Injection)

Please show Screeshot folder for details level

1) Evolent.ContactManager.Web is ASP.Net MVC C# Application for Managing Contacts, which uses Model View Controller Pattern
2) Evolent.Api is REST Full Service developed in WEB API 2.0 With EntityFramework 6.0 for rapid development 
3) Code First Approach for EntityFramework and IOC & DI used between EntityFramework and Web API to Decoupled between API & EntityFramework
